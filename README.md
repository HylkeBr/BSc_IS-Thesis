# Gradient Linguistic Acceptability with Neural Linguistic Models
Within this repository, the code used for the thesis project "Gradient Linguistic Acceptability with Neural Linguistic Models" of the Bachelor Information Science at the University of Groningen can be found. 

## Fine-tuned models
Both the fine-tuned models are fine-tuned on a filtered version of the [Dutch Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GroNLP/dutch-cola), which can be found on the GroNLP page on Hugging Face. From the dataset, all intermediate markings are left out for fine-tuning. This can also be seen in the fine-tuning code files. 
The fine-tuned models can also be found on Hugging Face. The links can be found below:
